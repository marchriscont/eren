**Description**
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.
This project is aimed towards current and incoming students to California State University, Fullerton. This app is made to make the process of registering for classes easier. As students at CSUF, we understand the struggles and main problems with the current registering system and wanted to find a way to make the process easier. With added features such as adding classes to your class cart and checking out classes along with rate my professor scores and reviews on the professors. 

**Installation**
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

**Usage**
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

**Support**
For support with this app contact us through discord or through github.

**Roadmap**
We plan to spread this project across all mobile platforms, specifically iPhones and hope to allow access to more users across campus and hope to potentially spread this application to other California State Universities.
